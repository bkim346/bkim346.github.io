  abstract={Odorants binding to olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) trigger bursts of action potentials, providing the brain with its only experience of the olfactory environment. Our recordings made in vivo from locust ORNs showed odor-elicited firing patterns comprise four distinct response motifs, each defined by a reliable temporal profile. Different odorants could elicit different response motifs from a given ORN, a property we term motif switching. Further, each motif undergoes its own form of sensory adaptation when activated by repeated plume-like odor pulses. A computational model constrained by our recordings revealed that organizing responses into multiple motifs provides substantial benefits for classifying odors and processing complex odor plumes':' each motif contributes uniquely to encode the plumeâ€™s composition and structure. Multiple motifs and motif switching further improve odor classification by expanding coding dimensionality. Our model demonstrated these response features could provide benefits for olfactory navigation, including determining the distance to an odor source.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract={Kilohertz electrical stimulation (KES) has enabled a novel new paradigm for spinal cord and peripheral nerve stimulation to treat a variety of neurological diseases. KES can excite or inhibit nerve activity and is used in many clinical devices today. However, the impact of different electrode materials on the efficacy of KES is unknown. We investigated the effect of different electrode materials and their respective charge injection mechanisms on KES nerve block thresholds using 20- and 40-kHz current-controlled sinusoidal KES waveforms. We evaluated the nerve block threshold and the power requirements for achieving an effective KES nerve block. In addition, we evaluated potential effects on the onset duration and recovery of normal conduction after delivery of KES. We found that thresholds and the onset and recovery of KES nerve block are not a function of the electrode material. In contrast, the power dissipation varies among electrode materials and is a function of the materials' properties at high frequencies. We conclude that materials with a proven track record of chronic stability, both for the tissue and electrode, are suitable for developing KES nerve block therapies.},

  abstract={Kilohertz electrical stimulation (KES) induces repeatable and reversible conduction block of nerve activity and is a potential therapeutic option for various diseases and disorders resulting from pathological or undesired neurological activity. However, successful translation of KES nerve block to clinical applications is stymied by many unknowns, such as the relevance of the onset response, acceptable levels of waveform contamination, and optimal electrode characteristics. We investigated the role of electrode geometric surface area on the KES nerve block threshold using 20- and 40-kHz current-controlled sinusoidal KES. Electrodes were electrochemically characterized and used to characterize typical KES waveforms and electrode charge characteristics. KES nerve block amplitudes, onset duration, and recovery of normal conduction after delivery of the KES were evaluated along with power requirements for effective KES nerve block. Results from this investigation demonstrate that increasing electrode geometric surface area provides for a more power-efficient KES nerve block. Reductions in block threshold by increased electrode surface area were found to be KES-frequency-dependent, with block thresholds and average power consumption reduced by greater than two times with 20-kHz KES waveforms and greater than three times for 40-kHz KES waveforms.},
