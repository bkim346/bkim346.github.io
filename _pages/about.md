This is mainly a repository website for the various things I do.

There will be a live data stream of the reef parameters. Also there will be update posts on various projects that I do, such as woodworking projects, reef keeping, reef automation, scuba diving etc. Also this is good practice to just barely understand the smallest amount of html and javascript haha...
