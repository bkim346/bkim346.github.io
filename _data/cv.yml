      Advisor: Dr. Mark Stopfer
      description:
        - Study the 3rd order chemosensory neurons and see how taste and smell information is integrated
        - Perform in vivo extracellular tetrode, intracellular sharp, and intracellular patch recordings in locusts
        - Trace recorded neurons stained with immunohistochemistry and image with confocal imaging
        - Align traced neurons to standardized brain with transformation matrix from CMTK
        - Design and create an odorant and tastant delivery system with fast response times (>5ms), accurate odor concentration (0-100%), and accurate timing of delivery for both stimulants simultaneously (<20ms)
        - Analyze spike rate and membrane potential changes and visualize data using MATLAB
